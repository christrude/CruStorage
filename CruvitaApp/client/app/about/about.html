          <p>The search for a new home can be a challenge. Several factors weigh into the decision making process: the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, the desired square footage. These requirements are tangible and easy to narrow down; but, what about the features that go beyond the tangible?</p>

          <p>If you are like millions of Americans, you are planning on having children or already have children. When looking for a home where you can raise your family, what do you care about? The founders of Cruvita have been involved in over 20,000 real estate transactions and one of the most commonly asked questions we hear from potential home buyers is:</p>

          <h2 class="center">How are the schools?</h2>
          <p>The answer: The Cruvita School Score. The exclusive algorithm has ranked and assigned most public schools in the United States to its own unique Cruvita School Score. Each score takes into account several aspects to assist you, the consumer, in deciding where you should buy a home, based on the quality of the school in the neighborhood and statistics based on socioeconomic data.</p>

          <p>Only objective data is used, not public opinion. The objective data is more than just test scores. It is a patent-pending algorithm, that uses educational data and several other pieces of socioeconomic data, including housing trends, to develop the score. Although it’s not unheard of, it’s incredibly difficult to have two schools with the same score, eliminating the problem of not being able to differentiate between the top schools. Though the ranking is self-explanatory, the lower the score, the better the school.</p>

          <p>In late 2015, in order to simplify the rankings, Cruvita assigned a grade score nationwide.  So a B+ in Maryland is equal to a B+ in Arizona.  This allows a way to quickly judge the school's rank versus the region or nation.</p>
