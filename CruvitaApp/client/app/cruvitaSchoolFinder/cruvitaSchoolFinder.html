            <p>The Cruvita™ School Finder is designed to assist homebuyers when they need to find out what schools are associated with a specific address. The results returned by the School Finder are based upon school boundary information supplied by the U.S. Department of Education and/or 3rd party GIS vendors selected by Cruvita, LLC. Addresses are not verified by Cruvita, LLC. In order to verify that a specific address is zoned for a specific school you must contact that school, or the school district that school resides in.</p>
