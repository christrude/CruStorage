      Cruvita School Score is derived by taking the most up to date information from The United States Department of Education, The United States Census Bureau, and current home sale trends. This score allows one to see how schools match up against one another based on the area of choice.</p>
      <p>In addition to giving each school a unique score, we have also provided each schoolâ€™s rank in their city/county, state, and the entire nation. The highest rated schools receive a <strong>Cruvita Medal of Excellence.</strong> Only the top 5% of the schools in an area receive a gold medal. The top 10% receive a silver medal and the top 25% receive a bronze medal.</p>
